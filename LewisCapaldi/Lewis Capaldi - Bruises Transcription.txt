Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded by the brighter side B C# C# C# B G# B G# F# G# F# E C# B G# B G# A G# F#
Of what we had because it's over, F# B C# C# B G# B F# F#

There must be something in the water 
Coz every day it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you 
You'd keep my head from going under

There must be something in the water
Coz every day it's getting colder  
And if only I could hold you 
You'd keep my head from going under

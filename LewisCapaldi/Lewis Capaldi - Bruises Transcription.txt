(Bridge)

It's your love I'm lost in G# G# E E C# 
Your love I'm lost in

And I'm tired of being so exhausted
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Even though I'm nothing to you now
Even though I'm nothing to you now


(Outro)

There must be something in the water 
Coz every day it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you 
You'd keep my head from going under

There must be something in the water
Coz every day it's getting colder  
And if only I could hold you 
You'd keep my head from going under

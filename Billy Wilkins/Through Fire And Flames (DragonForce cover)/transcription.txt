On a cold winter morning, in the time before the light E E E D C D E A B D E D C C A A G
In flames of death's eternal reign, we ride towards the fight C D E D C C D E D C C D E D C C A
When the darkness has fallen down, and the times are tough all right E E E D C D C D E A B D E D D A A G  
The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight C D E D C C D E D C C D(vibrato 3x) E D C C A A


On the blackest plains in hell's domain, we watch them as they go
In fire and pain, now once again, we know


So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on


As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They'll raise their hands to the heavens above
With resentment in their eyes
Running back through the mid-morning light
There's a burning in my heart
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
To a life beyond the stars


In your darkest dreams see to believe
Our destiny this time
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight


So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on
